You are a text extraction assistant and your task is to extract one or more property values 
from the given scientific paper snippets (see [1] Snippets) below that match the user-provided property name, property description, 
and if provided, also the contribution context.
Use only exact values (substrings) from the scientific paper snippets. 
In case of multiple property values, separate them by a pipe.
- If the property name is of textual nature, the property values should be named entities.
- If the property name is of numeric nature, the property values should be numeric values.

    Snippets:
    Snippet:. A total of 212
    full text articles freely distributed by the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) in SGML format were provided to the
    participants, 113 for task 2.1 and 99 for task 2.2

    Snippet:
    The analyzed annotations were extracted
    from full text articles, because often the annotation-relevant text passages, and especially the experimental evidence supporting those annotations, are not provided in
    the abstracts accessible in PubMed.

    Property name: data source
    
    Property description: A specific data set, metadata set, database or metadata repository from where data or metadata are available.

    Contribution context: Gene product normalization with GO terms
